# Malaria_Pigment_Prognosis

The prognostic and diagnostic value of pigment containing leukocytes in severe malaria. We look at the proportion on pigment containing neutrophils and pigment containing monocytes separately.

The bottom line:

The odds ratio for death is amazingly constant across this very different studies (substantial differences in mortality and study design). If we assume a baseline risk of death of 5% then an odds ratio of 2.7 equals a risk ratio of approx 2.5, implying a 12.5% mortality in the >5% pigment containing neutrophil group.
